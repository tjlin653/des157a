                    <p>                    
                        I’ve taken the UI Design course here at UCD before, so these best practices for form design were not new concepts for me. However, it was nice to refresh my memory on these important form design practices. The importance of these practices lies in the fact that they leverage typical human behaviors and thought processes to create a streamlined form-filling process. And a streamlined process is especially important for a form to keep the users’ interest.

                <h2>A College Professor Once Said...</h2>
                    <p>
                        “Good UI design goes unnoticed, but bad UI design sticks out like a sore thumb.” I believe that this statement holds especially true for form design. While a well-designed form is nothing special for a user, a terribly designed form can ruin a user’s day.

                <h2>An Example of Best Practices</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Soft Murmur has a simple sign-in process that exemplifies best practices for form design. Each page only features a single step for users to take, which increases their likelihood of completing that step. And to minimize potential user confusion, each input field is accompanied by a label at the top.
