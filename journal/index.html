                    Taking a course in UI design here at UC Davis has taught me a lot about how to organize information concisely. But sometimes, UI designers find themselves trying to handle too much content on a single page. This may feel like trying to solve a puzzle using pieces that don’t fit. Thus, I can understand the feeling UI designers must have felt when modal windows were first introduced.

                    However, while modal windows used to be a UI designer’s saving grace, they have now become a risky element to include in UI/UX design. Speaking from experience, users dislike having their flow of content disrupted. When done incorrectly, modals can feel jarring and annoying. Therefore, I believe that the tips that Naema Baskanderi provides in her article regarding when and how to use modals are worth taking note of.

                        I’ve taken the UI Design course here at UCD before, so these best practices for form design were not new concepts for me. However, it was nice to refresh my memory on these important form design practices. The importance of these practices lies in the fact that they leverage typical human behaviors and thought processes to create a streamlined form-filling process. And a streamlined process is especially important for a form to keep the users’ interest.

                        A college professor of mine once said: “Good UI design goes unnoticed, but bad UI design sticks out like a sore thumb.” I believe that this statement holds especially true for form design. While a well-designed form is nothing special for a user, a terribly designed form can ruin a user’s day.

                        A Soft Murmur has a simple sign-in process that exemplifies best practices for form design. Each page only features a single step for users to take, which increases their likelihood of completing that step. And to minimize potential user confusion, each input field is accompanied by a label at the top.
