            For my Every Picture Project, I went to the Raptor Center here at UCD to find a few good groups of photographs that I could use for stop motion. I have a few groups of photos from this trip of raptors feeding on small rodents. Through these photos, I want to elicit a feeling of mystery and eeriness. I also want these pictures to connect to my overall theme of the illusion of control.

            When experimenting with design ideas for my project, I did not yet know what I wanted the end product to look like. What I have in mind now, however, is a webpage with at least three rows of photos that slowly drift by horizontally. When the user hovers over any of the photos, the stop motion will begin playing, starting from the photo they hovered on. This will loop, so the starting photo won’t matter much.
